# Beautiful Lyrics Mobile

Tired of Spotify's boring lyrics? Hate Musixmatch's inaccuracy and basicness? This project aims to fix that by making lyrics *beautiful*, heavily based on [beautiful-lyrics](https://github.com/surfbryce/beautiful-lyrics) by [@surfbryce](https://github.com/surfbryce)

## Description
